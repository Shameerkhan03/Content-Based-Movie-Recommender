# Content-Based-Movie-Recommender
A content-based movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on their descriptions, genres, actors and director using **Bag of Words (BoW) and Cosine Similarity**. 
Built with **Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit** for an interactive UI.  

I used tmdb's movies data set available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?resource=download
